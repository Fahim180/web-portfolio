<p> A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server</p>

<p> 
    A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to function. A developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such a way that end users have no difficulty navigating the site. The website should not be so simple that it does not appeal to advanced users, nor should it be so complicated that the beginner is easily lost in the process.
